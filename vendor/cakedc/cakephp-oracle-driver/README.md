## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

The recommended way to install Composer packages is:

```
composer require cakedc/cakephp-oracle-driver
```

In bootstrap.php load plugin with bootstrap.

```php
	Plugin::load('CakeDC/OracleDriver', ['bootstrap' => true]);
```


## Requirements

- CakePHP 3.8
- an Oracle PHP extension
  - OCI8 (PHP extension built with PHP)
  - PDO_OCI (PHP extension built with PHP)

### Notes on extensions

For full support, it is recommended to run the `OCI8` extension if possible.

While `PDO_OCI` might be simpler to set up, there are some limitations (e.g.
it doesn't support the stored code layer, so only the SQL layer will be
available.)

## Datasource configuration

Here is an example datasource configuration:

```php
        <?php
return [
    'Datasources' => [
        'default' => [
            'className' => 'CakeDC\OracleDriver\Database\OracleConnection',
            'driver' => 'CakeDC\OracleDriver\Database\Driver\OracleOCI', # For OCI8
            #'driver' => 'CakeDC\\OracleDriver\\Database\\Driver\\OraclePDO', # For PDO_OCI
            'persistent' => true,           // Database persistent connection between http requests
            'host' => 'oracle11g',          // Database host name or IP address
            //'port' => 'nonstandard_port', // Database port number (default: 1521)
            'username' => 'blogs',          // Database username
            'password' => 'password',       // Database password
            'database' => 'XE',             // Database name (maps to Oracle's `SERVICE_NAME`)
            'sid' => '',                    // Database System ID (maps to Oracle's `SID`)
            'instance' => '',               // Database instance name (maps to Oracle's `INSTANCE_NAME`)
            'pooled' => '',                 // Database pooling (maps to Oracle's `SERVER=POOLED`)
            'flags' => [],                  // Database low level parameters for OCI or PDO connection. Auto-generated by default
            'encoding' => '',               // Database charset (default same as database charset)
            'init' => [],                   // Array of queries executed at connection
            'cacheMetadata' => true,        // Enable cakephp schema caching
        ]
    ]
];
```


As you can see, the `className` and `driver` need switched to Oracle-specific
classes. The driver will depend on whether you want to use `PDO` or not. The
`database` name "XE" in this case, is defined as the `SERVICE_NAME` in Oracle's
system-wide `tnsnames.ora` file.

The above array format is translated into Oracle's
[Easy Connection Naming][oracle-ecn]. You can find the logic for this in
`\CakeDC\OracleDriver\Database\Driver\OracleBase::getDSN()`.
