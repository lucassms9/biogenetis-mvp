# CakePHP Schema Shell
In case of using schema CakePHP will support and create automatically
sequences and triggers for autoincrement fields.

# Migrations alternative: Liquibase
Current Phinx, the default migrations engine for CakePHP, does not have driver to connect with Oracle databases.

We've included this feature in the roadmap for future releases, meanwhile you could use
[Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) to maintain your database migrations.

- Check the [Liquibase quickstart](http://www.liquibase.org/quickstart.html) here for a detailed example.
Note you'll need to download the JDBC driver here [Oracle JDBC Driver](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html)
